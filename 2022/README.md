# Advent of Code 2022

| Day  | Language     | Experience                                                              | Technique highlights                |
| :--- | :----------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| 01   | Perl         | Like being a wise man riding a camel!                                   | Eminently readable. :)              |
| 02   | R            | Dataframe dark elven magic not to be repeated.                          | Row / column-wise manipulation      |
| 03   | C            | Still trying to `fgets` about it.                                       | ASCII conversions                   |
| 04   | Shell        | Ugly but hard working.                                                  | Coordinate Math                     |
| 05   | Raku*        | Not the camel I was looking for.                                        | Regex, Stacks                       |
| 06   | PHP          | Felt like 2003 and potpourri.                                           | Sets                                |
| 07   | Kotlin*      | I really wanted a ready-made Christmas tree.                            | Iterative search of recursive data  |
| 08   | Julia*       | Endearing at first but got awkward under the mistltoe                   | Grid search                         |
| 09   | Ruby*        | Not the shiniest gem, yet treastures may lay within                     | Hashing                             |
| 10   | Go**         | A fruit cake: filling, predictable, but somehow lacking heart           | More iteration (yawn)               |
| 11   | Groovy*      | A glitter bomb: sparkly and bright, but gets everywhere                 | Closures                            |
| 12   | C++          | Like lighting the Christmas tree with real candles and heading to bed.  | Dijkstra's algorithm                |
| 13   | Javascript** | Hakuna matata! Slimy, yet satisfying!                                   | Recursion                           |
| 14   | Nim*         | A star! But still yonder afar! (maturing)                               | More grid search                    |
| 15   | Elixir*      | Beautiful and glistening yet as rigid and unyielding as ice.            | Functional: sets vs. ranges         |
| 16   | C# **        | Many fine presents to unwrap under the MS Treeâ„¢.                        | Held-Karp, Generators               |
| 17   | Dart*        | Nifty! Every kind of ornament is being added, but where's my deep copy! | Simulation, cycle detection, Regex  |
| 18   | F# *         | Flexible & expressive but a little slow on the draw.                    | Functional, grid search             |
| 19   | Lua*         | A primitive weapon from a more civilized age.                           | Branch and bound + DFS              |
| 20   | Typescript*  | Beautiful wrapping paper, but I'm afraid to see what's inside.          | Circular doubly linked list, Modulo |
| 21   | Scala        | A supple staff for every kind of ninjitsu (except breaking loops)       | Lazy Eval, Secant Root Finding      |
| 22   | Swift**      | Well-designed and expressive but bordering on complex.                  | Maze walk, 3D rotations             |
| 23   | Python       | I don't normally Python, but when I do, I go 3.10+                      | Hash of Arrays, Closures            |
| 24   | Java         | Reasonable, understandable, but lacking bells and whistles.             | DFS, branch and bound               |
| 25   | Rust         | A true gift to work with: expressive, rigorous, and blazingly fast.     | Number base conversion              |
