| Day  | Language | Experience                                                    |
| :--- | :------- | :------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 01   | Perl     | Like being a wise man riding a camel!                         |
| 02   | R        | Dataframe dark elven magic not to be repeated.                |
| 03   | C        | Still trying to `fgets` about it.                             |
| 04   | Shell    | Ugly but hard working.                                        |
| 05   | Raku*    | Not the camel I was looking for.                              |
| 06   | PHP      | Felt like 2003 and potpourri.                                 |
| 07   | Kotlin*  | I really wanted a ready-made Christmas tree.                  |
| 08   | Julia*   | Endearing at first but got awkward under the mistltoe         |
| 09   | Ruby*    | Not the shiniest gem, yet treastures may lay within           |
| 10   | Go**     | A fruit cake: filling, predictable, but somehow lacking heart |
| 11   | Groovy*  | A glitter bomb, sparkly and bright, but gets everywhere       |
| 12   |          |                                                               |


\* *First time caller, long time listener*
\*\* Everyone deserves a second chance.
