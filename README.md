| Day  | Language     | Experience                                                              |
| :--- | :----------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 01   | Perl         | Like being a wise man riding a camel!                                   |
| 02   | R            | Dataframe dark elven magic not to be repeated.                          |
| 03   | C            | Still trying to `fgets` about it.                                       |
| 04   | Shell        | Ugly but hard working.                                                  |
| 05   | Raku*        | Not the camel I was looking for.                                        |
| 06   | PHP          | Felt like 2003 and potpourri.                                           |
| 07   | Kotlin*      | I really wanted a ready-made Christmas tree.                            |
| 08   | Julia*       | Endearing at first but got awkward under the mistltoe                   |
| 09   | Ruby*        | Not the shiniest gem, yet treastures may lay within                     |
| 10   | Go**         | A fruit cake: filling, predictable, but somehow lacking heart           |
| 11   | Groovy*      | A glitter bomb: sparkly and bright, but gets everywhere                 |
| 12   | C++          | Like lighting the Christmas tree with real candles and heading to bed.  |
| 13   | Javascript** | Hakuna matata! Slimy, yet satisfying!                                   |
| 14   | Nim*         | A star! But still yonder afar! (maturing)                               |
| 15   | Elixir*      | Beautiful and glistening yet as rigid and unyielding as ice.            |
| 16   | C# **        | Many fine presents to unwrap under the MS Treeâ„¢.                        |
| 17   | Dart*        | Nifty! Every kind of ornament is being added, but where's my deep copy! |
|      |              |                                                                         |
