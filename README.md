| Day  | Language | Experience                                     |
| :--- | :------- | :--------------------------------------------- |
| 01   | Perl     | Like being a wise man riding a camel!          |
| 02   | R        | Dataframe dark elven magic not to be repeated. |
| 03   | C        | Still trying to `fgets` about it.              |
| 04   | Shell    | Ugly but hard working.                         |
| 05   | Raku*    | Not the camel I was looking for.               |
| 06   | PHP      | Feels like 2003 and potpourri.                 |
| 07   | Kotlin*  | I really wanted a ready-made Christmas tree.   |
